'''This is the second module of the UiBdoc intro to Python for
researchers. It covers the basic of scientific computing in Python.

To get comfortable with numpy, start by completing some of the
problems at this link:
https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/

Once you feel comfortable, solve the last problem from the basic
module using numpy arrays and functions. Instead of creating a dict at
the end, use pyplot to plot a histogram of the data. The method you
need it plt.hist(). See this link for its API:
https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html

'''

import numpy as np # allows calling function with np.f() instead of numpy.f()
import scipy as sp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

'''

task: Use scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit a curve to noisy data.

task: Use pandas to write data to disk and read it back again. Plot
the data using pyplot.
